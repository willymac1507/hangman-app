How to Play
01
Choose a category
First, choose a word category, like animals or movies.
The computer then randomly selects a secret word from that
topic and shows you blanks for each letter of the word.
02
Guess letters
Take turns guessing letters. The computer fills in the
relevant blank spaces if your guess is correct. If it's
wrong, you lose some health, which empties after eight
incorrect guesses.
03
Win or lose
You win by guessing all the letters in the word before your
health runs out. If the health bar empties before you guess
the word, you lose.
